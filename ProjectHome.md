My goal is to turn a Arduino into a CNC motor controller to work with popular end products like MACH3 and EMC2 (Linux).  The device itself will connect to the controlling computer using the usb serial connection, but possibly in the future it would be cool to look at using a xbee controller to get communication running.  This will only be the code.  The components to control the motors will have to be done in another section.  I am looking for a cheap way to create a 3-5 axis cnc controller though, so if you have any experience with arduinos, gcode, or cncs in general please feel free to chip in, or just post comments on what you would like to see it do.
