#Project Timeline and updates

# Project Timeline #

## Step1 - Project Creation ##
This is getting the project up and running and also make a support website, so that we can put all the information about the electronics portion and some design ideas for the cnc machine for home hobbyists.  I am also interested in setting up programs for high school students to get education on designing, developing and other aspects.  So this will probably encompass that as well.  The other part to this step is getting a project setup with the Arduino package in it.  I think a project discussion group will probably be a good idea as well.

### Step 1 Results ###
So I just setup a couple of websites with google sites one for the high school technology and the other for the ardmatic project itself.  They can be found at:

and

The Ardmatic group is also up and running, please feel free to join and get ideas.  The more that people comment, the better I know of how to push the project and where to take my efforts.  The group can be found at:
